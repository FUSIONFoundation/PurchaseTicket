Fusion purchase ticket

The PSN network is powered by a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm that requires network participants to set up a node and purchase ‘tickets’ in order to be selected to validate blocks on the chain. 

On the Payable Stage Network, the cost of a staking ticket is 200 P-FSN. Once a ticket is purchased, it enters the lottery to pack and validate the next block. The ticket remains in the lottery pool until it is picked. This means that if your ticket is not picked for a block it automatically enters the lottery to compete to validate the following block 15 seconds later (and so on) until it is picked.

1. If your ticket is not picked within 30 days, the staked 200 P-FSN are returned to your wallet and you will need to purchase a new ticket to participate.

2. If your ticket is picked to validate a block, then the 200 P-FSN used for staking will be returned to your wallet immediately with an additional reward of 2.5 P-FSN (and later 0.625 ERC-20 FSN bonus reward).


You can purchase tickets through the user interface at autobuy.fusionnetwork.io


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
